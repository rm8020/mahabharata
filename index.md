# The Story of Mahabharata

<b>NOTE</b> Editors and Contributors are welcome: I do lots of spelling and grammar mistakes, i type fast but never learned typing hence sometime miss words while I type assuming that the word is in there. 

This repo is my attempt to write the story of Mahabharata and at the same time provide some insights (over time). I was always intrigued by the story of Mahabharata.

Mahabharata is one of the oldest and largest epics in human history. The story of Mahabharata contains lot of stories inside it.

Will expand on the readme as the time progress.

The repo basically is a collection of the md files. I don't think I expect any code in this repo.

Hope I will continue this journey

## Enjoy the EPIC
