The Story of Mahabharata

<b>NOTE</b> Editors and Contributors are welcome: I do lots of spelling and grammer mistakes, i type fast but never learned typing hence sometime miss words while i type assuming that the word in in there. 
 
This repo is my attempt to write the story of Mahabharta and at the same time provide some insights (over time). I was always intrigued by the story of Mahabharta. 

Mahabharta is one of the the oldest and largest epics in human history. The story of Mahabharta contains lot of strories inside it.

Will expand on the readme as the time progress. 

The repo basically is a collection of the md files. I don't think I expect any code in this repo.

Hope I will continue this journey
