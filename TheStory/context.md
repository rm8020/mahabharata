# What, Why and How

## What is Mahabharata?

## Why I am writing this?

I am an IT consultant. I was born and brought up India but currenty living in New Zealand.
I have been really intrigued by the story of Mahabharata from multiple angles. Mahabharata is the biggest and the most wondeful EPIC. I just want to understand the story from various perspetive and provide mine. 
I am no writer (which you already know by styleo of writing) and I plan to write in plain and simple english.

I am a Hindu and Maharbharat is also a sacret text for me especially the Bhagwad Geeta (which is contained in the Bhisma Parv). 
One can say Bhagwad Gita itself is a culmination of all the spiritual knowledge. I am looking forward to reading that part and write about it. 

But apart from a sacred text I belive Mahabharata is a woderful story and at the same time a great teacher. 

## How: What is my method?

I am evolving my method but as of now I am just using couple of sources which itself are huge.
i am also using google to search certain terms, locationa and people whom I am not familiar with to gain more understanding.
Mahabharta is divided into the 18 Parvas and I will also use the same divisons for the sections but I may take more liberty with the chapters. 

Though I have a general understanding of the story but I have never read the complete text before so to write my own adaptation my options are basically

  a) read all the sources and then start writing this text - 
   * leading to a better,
   * consistent and
   * more comprehsive text 
   * with less number of iteractions
   
  b) read a section (section could be a whole parva or a part) and write about that. This option means 
   * my text may not be consistent, 
   * I may know accurately know what I am writing as it's just the first reading of my source text,
   * I will need lot of iterations and corrections
   * but this option means I can start immediately and this means I may not loose interest.
   
I have choosen Option B so that I can start immediately. The option also has a better chance of me to continue to have the interest in the project (I loose interest fast and I chosen a two year project!)
  
For me, the intention is to imrove my own understanding of the world by the way of Mahabharata.
Mahabharata is the ultimate and the largest EPIC and by no means I can have first draft ready in less than 18 months. I am targeting 2 years to finish the first draft.
